## 1. Tech Stacks

### Overview
GitBuddy-AI uses free/open-source tools to ensure $0 cost, cross-platform compatibility, and modularity. Each module leverages specific technologies tailored to its role, with a focus on simplicity for laymen and ease of maintenance for Odoo-trained developers.

### Tech Stacks by Module

#### 1.1 UI Module
- **Purpose**: Layman-friendly dashboard for inputs, validation, and transparency.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Streamlit** (v1.38.0, free, open-source): Python-based web-like UI, runs on Windows/Ubuntu.
  - **Mermaid.js** (v10.9.1, free, open-source): Generates flowcharts for “under the hood” explainers.
  - **CSS**: Custom styles for readability.
- **Rationale**: Streamlit’s simplicity suits laymen (e.g., one-click buttons), and Mermaid.js enhances transparency, aligning with CyberShield-Easy’s user-friendly scans.

#### 1.2 AI Engine Module
- **Purpose**: Processes inputs, generates specs, code, and workflows.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Qwen2.5** (7B model, free, open-source): Local LLM via Ollama (v0.3.12, free), runs on 16GB RAM/4GB GPU.
  - **Grok 3** (free tier, xAI): Remote LLM for web searches (DeepSearch mode).
  - **Hugging Face Inference API** (free tier): Fallback for low-end hardware.
  - **Python** (v3.11): Core scripting language.
- **Rationale**: Qwen2.5 ensures offline capability, Grok 3 adds context (e.g., RocketAutomation’s maritime APIs), and Hugging Face supports scalability, keeping costs at $0.

#### 1.3 GitHub Integration Module
- **Purpose**: Manages GitHub repos, commits, and Actions.
- **Technologies**:
  - **GitPython** (v3.1.43, free, open-source): Python library for Git operations.
  - **GitHub Actions** (free tier for public repos): Automates workflows (e.g., setup, test, deploy).
  - **PyGithub** (v2.3.0, free, open-source): API for GitHub interactions.

## 2. White Paper

### Title
**GitBuddy-AI: Democratizing GitHub Automation with AI-Driven Modularity**

### Abstract
GitBuddy-AI is an open-source, AI-driven tool that automates GitHub project management, enabling laymen to create and maintain projects with 2% effort (e.g., input, validation) while AI handles 98% of tasks (e.g., repo setup, code generation, deployment). Built with free tools (Qwen2.5, Streamlit, Netlify), it’s cross-platform, transparent, and self-maintaining, integrating with projects like CyberShield-Easy (cybersecurity) and RocketAutomation (maritime). Its five modular sections—UI, AI Engine, GitHub Integration, Maintenance, and Validation—communicate via APIs, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### Problem Statement
Laymen struggle with GitHub’s complexity (e.g., repos, PRs), and developers face repetitive tasks (e.g., setup, testing). Existing tools lack layman accessibility, cost efficiency ($0 budget), and modularity for diverse projects. GitBuddy-AI addresses this by automating GitHub workflows, providing a simple UI, and maintaining itself with AI.

### Solution
GitBuddy-AI offers:
- **Layman-Friendly UI**: Streamlit dashboard with one-click buttons and plain-English status (e.g., “AI is testing your app”).
- **AI Automation**: Qwen2.5/Grok 3 generate specs, code, and workflows, detecting project needs (e.g., ClamAV for CyberShield-Easy).
- **Modularity**: Five sections (UI, AI Engine, GitHub Integration, Maintenance, Validation) with FastAPI communication.
- **Self-Maintenance**: AI fixes errors (e.g., missing dependencies), logs actions, and creates developer guides.
- **Transparency**: Dashboard explains processes (e.g., “What’s a commit?”) with flowcharts.
- **Cost**: $0 using free/open-source tools.

### Benefits
- **Laymen**: Build projects (e.g., RocketAutomation’s voyage tracker) without GitHub knowledge.
- **Developers**: Odoo-trained juniors review PRs in minutes, guided by AI docs.
- **Scalability**: Integrates with any project via plugins (e.g., maritime APIs, security scans).
- **Sustainability**: Local LLMs and free hosting minimize environmental/cost impact.

### Conclusion
GitBuddy-AI democratizes software development by bridging the gap between laymen and GitHub, leveraging AI for automation and modularity for flexibility, all at zero cost.

## 4. Developer Notes

### Overview
These notes guide Odoo-trained developers in building, testing, and maintaining GitBuddy-AI. The project leverages your modularity expertise (e.g., Odoo freight module) for its five-section architecture.

### Key Guidelines
- **Modularity**: Each module (UI, AI Engine, etc.) is independent but uses FastAPI for communication. Treat modules like Odoo components.
- **AI Reliance**: Qwen2.5 automates 98% of tasks (e.g., code generation). Review outputs like Odoo module configs.
- **Layman Focus**: Ensure the UI is as simple as CyberShield-Easy’s scan buttons.
- **Troubleshooting**: Check `/logs/errors.log` and `/docs/troubleshoot.md` for AI-generated fixes/guides.
- **Cross-Platform**: Test on Windows (layman) and Ubuntu (developer). Use Docker for consistency.

### Module-Specific Notes
1. **UI Module**:
   - Use Streamlit’s `st.button` for actions (e.g., “Start Project”).
   - Add Mermaid.js flowcharts for transparency (e.g., `mermaid diagram repo->code->test`).
   - Test: `streamlit run src/ui/app.py`.
2. **AI Engine**:
   - Configure Qwen2.5 prompts in `spec_gen.py` (e.g., “Generate spec for {input}”).
   - Fallback to Grok 3 for complex tasks (e.g., RocketAutomation’s API detection).
   - Test: `python src/ai_engine/spec_gen.py --input "CyberShield-Easy"`.
3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Set GitHub token in `repo_manager.py` (store securely in `.env`).
   - Use `actions.py` to apply templates from `/templates`.
   - Test: `python src/github_integration/actions.py --workflow setup.yml`.
4. **Maintenance**:
   - Configure Loguru to log to `/logs/app.log` and `/logs/errors.log`.
   - Implement `fixer.py` to parse errors (e.g., “Missing numpy”).
   - Generate docs: `mkdocs build`.
5. **Validation**:
   - Setup Netlify in `deploy.py` for staging (e.g., CyberShield-Easy’s scan UI).
   - Use Giskard in `evaluator.py` to check code quality.
   - Test: `python src/validation/feedback.py --url http://staging.netlify.app`.

### Best Practices
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear messages (e.g., “Add ClamAV workflow for CyberShield-Easy”).
- **PR Reviews**: Review AI-generated PRs in GitHub UI, focusing on YAML syntax and dependencies.
- **Error Handling**: If AI fixes fail, create issues with `docs_gen.py` guides.
- **Testing**: Run `pytest` on each module before merging.
- **Documentation**: Update `/docs/index.md` with new features.

### Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - Qwen2.5 fails: Check Ollama (`ollama ps`) or use Hugging Face.
  - Workflow fails: Check `/logs/errors.log` for YAML errors.
  - UI crashes: Verify Streamlit (`pip install streamlit==1.38.0`).
- **AI Fixes**: Run `fixer.py` to retry failed tasks (e.g., `python fixer.py --log errors.log`).
