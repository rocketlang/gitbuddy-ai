Thank you for the additional requirements: you want **GitBuddy-AI** to incorporate a **self-curing** and **self-evolving** mechanism, where the AI trains itself, retains training data for portability, and remains **AI-agnostic**. This ensures that switching LLMs (e.g., from Qwen2.5 to Grok 3 or another model) requires no additional training or minimal data adjustments, maintaining the project’s 98% AI-driven nature, 2% layman input, and compatibility with projects like **CyberShield-Easy** or **RocketAutomation**. The design must align with your minimal team (Bhargavi, junior Odoo-trained, 25 hours/week; senior developer, 6 hours/week), free/open-source tools, cross-platform support (Windows for laymen, Ubuntu for developers), and $0 budget. Below, I’ve revised the Markdown file to integrate these self-curing, self-evolving, and AI-agnostic features, streamlining tasks for Bhargavi’s junior skills and extending the schedule slightly to accommodate the added complexity. The file retains the **Tech Stacks**, **White Paper**, **Project Paper**, **Developer Notes**, and **Project Schedule** (starting May 21, 2025) with a Gantt chart.

### Revised Markdown File for GitBuddy-AI

```markdown
# GitBuddy-AI Project Documentation (v1.0.2)

## Overview
**GitBuddy-AI** is a standalone, AI-driven tool that automates GitHub project management with 98% AI functionality and 2% layman input. It’s free, open-source, cross-platform (Windows for laymen, Ubuntu for developers), transparent, self-maintaining, and modular, integrating with projects like CyberShield-Easy (cybersecurity) or RocketAutomation (maritime). The project has five modular sections—UI, AI Engine, GitHub Integration, Maintenance, and Validation—interconnected via APIs and a SQLite database. It features a **self-curing** and **self-evolving** AI mechanism that trains itself, retains portable training data, and is **AI-agnostic**, allowing seamless LLM switching (e.g., Qwen2.5 to Grok 3) with minimal or no retraining.

This document includes the Tech Stacks, White Paper, Project Paper, Developer Notes, and Project Schedule (starting May 21, 2025) with a Gantt-style timeline, tailored for one junior Odoo-trained developer (Bhargavi, 25 hours/week) and one senior Odoo-trained developer (6 hours/week).

## 1. Tech Stacks

### Overview
GitBuddy-AI uses free/open-source tools to ensure $0 cost, leveraging AI to minimize Bhargavi’s effort. The stack supports self-curing (auto-fixing errors), self-evolving (continuous learning), and AI-agnosticism (portable training data), aligning with Bhargavi’s junior Odoo skills.

#### 1.1 UI Module
- **Purpose**: Layman dashboard for inputs, validation, transparency.
- **Technologies**:

- **Hugging Face Datasets**: Stores JSONL training data (e.g., `{"prompt": "Generate spec", "output": "..."}`).
- **SQLite**: Retains training metadata for portability.
- **Rationale**: Ensures AI-agnosticism; data can be reused with any LLM.

### Hardware Requirements

## 4. Developer Notes

### Overview
These notes guide Bhargavi (junior Odoo, 25 hours/week) and the senior (6 hours/week) in building GitBuddy-AI. AI handles 98% of tasks, with self-curing/evolving mechanisms reducing Bhargavi’s effort.

### Key Guidelines
- **AI-Driven**: Qwen2.5/LangChain generates code, self-trains on feedback.
- **Self-Curing**: AI fixes errors (e.g., YAML syntax), logs to `/logs`.
- **Self-Evolving**: AI updates training data in `/data/training.jsonl`.
- **AI-Agnostic**: Training data portable via Hugging Face Datasets.
- **Modularity**: Modules like Odoo components.
- **Senior Role**: Guide Bhargavi, review PRs.

### Module-Specific Notes
1. **UI Module**:
   - Edit `src/ui/app.py` for buttons.
   - AI adds Mermaid.js flowcharts.
   - Test: `streamlit run src/ui/app.py`.
   - Bhargavi: 5 hours/week, configure UI.
   - Senior: 1 hour/week, review logic.
2. **AI Engine**:
   - Configure LangChain in `spec_gen.py` for self-training.
   - Store training data: `/data/training.jsonl`.
   - Test: `python src/ai_engine/spec_gen.py --input "CyberShield-Easy"`.
   - Bhargavi: 8 hours/week, tweak prompts.
   - Senior: 2 hours/week, validate training.
3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Setup GitPython in `repo_manager.py`.
   - AI generates `/templates/setup.yml`.
   - Test: `python src/github_integration/actions.py --workflow setup.yml`.
   - Bhargavi: 5 hours/week, apply workflows.
   - Senior: 1 hour/week, check YAML.
4. **Maintenance**:
   - Setup Loguru in `logger.py`.
   - AI implements `fixer.py` for self-curing.
   - Test: `python src/maintenance/fixer.py --log errors.log`.
   - Bhargavi: 4 hours/week, monitor logs.
   - Senior: 1 hour/week, review fixes.
5. **Validation**:

   - Test: `python src/validation/feedback.py --url http://staging.netlify.app`.
   - Bhargavi: 3 hours/week, setup deployment.
   - Senior: 1 hour/week, check feedback.

### Self-Curing/Evolving Notes
- **Self-Curing**:
  - LangChain analyzes logs (`/logs/errors.log`) to fix errors (e.g., adds missing `pip install`).
  - Example: Failed workflow → AI updates YAML, commits fix.
- **Self-Evolving**:
  - LangChain stores prompt/output pairs in `/data/training.jsonl` (e.g., `{"prompt": "Generate spec", "output": "..."}`).
  - AI retrains on feedback (e.g., “Add ClamAV scan” improves future specs).
- **AI-Agnostic**:
  - Training data exported to Hugging Face Datasets for portability.
  - Example: Switch to Grok 3 by loading `/data/training.jsonl`.
- **Bhargavi**: Monitor training data size (<1GB), test fixes.
- **Senior**: Verify LangChain setup, ensure data portability.

### Best Practices
- **Commits**: Clear messages (e.g., “Add self-curing fix”).
- **PRs**: Bhargavi creates; senior reviews in GitHub UI.
- **Testing**: AI-generated `pytest` scripts.
- **Docs**: AI updates `/docs/index.md`.

### Troubleshooting
- **Qwen2.5 Fails**: Use Grok 3 or Hugging Face.
- **Training Data Corrupts**: Restore from `/data/training_backup.jsonl`.
- **UI Crashes**: Check `streamlit==1.38.0`.
