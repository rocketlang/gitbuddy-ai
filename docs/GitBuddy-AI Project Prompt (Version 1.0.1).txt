# GitBuddy-AI Project Prompt (Version 1.0.1)

## Project Name
GitBuddy-AI

## Version
1.0.1 (Updated May 14, 2025)

## Objective
Create a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/rocketlang/gitbuddy-ai`) to automate GitHub project setup and management with 98% AI-driven tasks and 2% layman input, integrating with **CyberShield-Easy** and **RocketAutomation**. Enhance with AG-UI protocol for modular, self-adaptive features.

## Core Features (Updated with AG-UI)
- **Repo Creation**: AI creates GitHub repo with predefined structure.
- **File Population**: Generates minimal files (workflow, UI, AI logic, logs, docs).
- **Layman UI**: Streamlit dashboard with maritime-inspired prompts, powered by AG-UI for real-time interaction.
- **Self-Suring**: AG-UI monitors AI outputs for reliability.
- **Self-Healing**: AG-UI auto-corrects errors using user feedback.
- **Self-Evolving**: AG-UI learns from user interactions to improve AI outputs.
- **AI-Agnostic**: Portable data for LLMs (Ollama, Grok).

## AG-UI Integration (New Methodology)
- **Modular Components**: Shared streaming chat widget, event handler hub, training data collector.
- **LLM-Driven Training**: Captures user interactions (e.g., commit message edits) via AG-UI events for fine-tuning.
- **Self-Adaptive Features**: Self-suring/healing/evolving driven by AG-UI event feedback loop.
- **Training Data Reuse**: JSONL format for cross-project sharing with Rocketlang, Cybershield.

## Files Needed
- `.github/workflows/setup.yml`: Basic GitHub Action workflow.
- `src/ui/app.py`: Streamlit UI with AG-UI integration.
- `src/ai_engine/spec_gen.py`: AI-driven spec generation placeholder.
- `data/training.jsonl`: Training data for LLMs.
- `logs/app.log`: Log file for runtime/errors.
- `logs/health_metrics.log`: Self-suring metrics.
- `logs/healing_actions.log`: Self-healing actions.
- `docs/index.md`: Developer guide.
- `docs/layman_guide.md`: Layman guide (to be created).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Layman-friendly overview and setup.

## Requirements
- Hardcode project name `GitBuddy-AI for CyberShield-Easy`, repo URL `https://github.com/rocketlang/gitbuddy-ai`.
- Python script (`init_gitbuddy.py`) with no user input.
- Include developer/layman comments (maritime analogies).
- Cross-platform (Windows/Ubuntu), free/open-source, within ₹6000/month.
- Error-proof with clear troubleshooting.
- Hardware: 12–16GB RAM laptops, 50 Mbps broadband.

## Constraints
- Minimal input, Windows-compatible, avoid complex YAML/Markdown.
- Budget: ₹6000/month, using existing hardware.

## Team
- Anil (layman, maritime expert).
- Bhargavi (junior, Odoo-trained, joins May 21, 2025).
- Indra (senior, Odoo-trained, joins May 21, 2025).

## Timeline
- Start: May 14, 2025.
- Initial setup complete: May 21, 2025.

## Layman Comment
This is your ship’s voyage plan, Anil, now with a smarter crew (AG-UI) that learns and fixes itself to make your journey easier!
