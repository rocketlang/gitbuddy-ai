- **LLM-Driven Training**:
  - Uses Ollama for 5% simple tasks (e.g., commit messages).
  - Uses Grok API for 98% complex tasks (e.g., code analysis).
  - Training data stored in `data/training.jsonl` for cross-project reuse.
- **Self-Adaptive Features**:
  - Self-suring validates AI outputs (e.g., commit message quality).
  - Self-healing auto-corrects errors (e.g., reformats commit messages).
  - Self-evolving learns user preferences over time.
